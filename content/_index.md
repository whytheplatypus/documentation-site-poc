**What is the Blue Button API?**

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Blue Button Application Programming Interface (API) is a tool that enables Medicare beneficiaries to connect their Medicare claims data to the applications, services, and research programs they trust. It also provides developers, organizations, and companies the ability to build apps that can provide unique and innovative services to Medicare beneficiaries.

**For Medicare Beneficiaries:**

  - One of the core goals of Blue Button is to give you, the Medicare beneficiary, more control, choice, and information about your healthcare data. 
  - As a beneficiary, you can choose to share your data with the applications you trust and want to use.
  - The applications you trust can continue to retrieve new claims information. You can disconnect an application from receiving new information by going to the application dashboard in your account on the MyMedicare.gov portal. Applications may also provide an option to disconnect from our API within your account in that application. Accessing that capability will vary from application to application.

**For Developers:**

  - Enables you as a developer or member of a development team to register or edit your application settings that interact with the Blue Button 2.0 API.
  - You can use our sample data (also known as "synthetic data") to build and test the functionality of your application with realistic Medicare data.
  - Use standards-based protocols for beneficiary authorization (OAuth 2.0) and for beneficiary data access (HL7 FHIR) enabling you to use popular code libraries to speed your development. 

**For Companies/Organizations:**

  - Our Terms of Use and policies provide clear feedback on how to build applications that protect Medicare beneficiaries and provide valuable services.
  - After our approval process, we enable apps to use Blue Button to deliver data to their users.
  - Access summary and business case documentation to help you understand the value of Blue Button 2.0 and to support your organization's decision to integrate our API.

**For Researchers:**

- Our API has been built to support the Sync-for-Science specification making it easier for you to enable beneficiaries to donate their information to your research project
- Our API issues access tokens that allow data to be retrieved without requiring the continual intervention of the beneficiary after initial onboarding to a study.
